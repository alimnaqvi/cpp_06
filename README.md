# C++ Module 06: C++ casts

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 school.

Core concepts learned and applied:

- Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types
  - Literals
  - Static casting
  - std::stoi, std::stod, std::stof, etc.
  - Function templates for cleaner and maintainable code
- Exercise 01: Serialization
  - reinterpret_cast
- Exercise 02: Identify real type
  - dynamic_cast (downcasting) with pointers and references to polymorphic classes
